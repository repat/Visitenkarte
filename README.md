## Tags
* `<meta>`-tags
* `<title>`
* `<div id="content" class="vcard" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Person">`

## Design
It's based on a design I found on [kaiser.me](http://kaiser.me), which itself is "Inspired by Tim Van Damme's online card (timvandamme.com)", as stated in the sourcecode. I'll make it a little bit prettier in the next couple of weeks.

## Disclaimer
I used the [placeholder name John Doe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe) for my example. If someone really has an online profile with this name or is even a webdesigner and cook from Sydney, it is a pure coincidence.

Logos and images are trademarked by their respective companies.
